## 🌟 Let's Get Started

### 🧠 What is Dart?

Dart is a **statically typed, compiled programming language** developed by Google. It is optimized for building user interfaces, especially in the context of cross-platform mobile, web, and desktop applications with Flutter.

### ⚙️ Dart Compilation Modes

Dart supports two types of compilation:

- **AOT (Ahead-of-Time)**  
  Compiles your code into native machine code *before* execution.  
  Used in **Flutter release builds** for faster startup and better performance.

- **JIT (Just-In-Time)**  
  Compiles your code *during* execution.  
  Used in **Flutter development mode** for features like hot reload, enabling rapid iteration.
